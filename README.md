## Business Problem

The **Indianapolis Mayor’s Office – Office of Parks & Recreation** required a data-driven approach to evaluate 2026 park service pricing while balancing:

- Revenue growth  
- Cost‑recovery targets  
- Public demand sensitivity  

---

## Project Objective

Develop an Excel-based analytics system that could:

- Estimate **price elasticities**
- Simulate multiple **pricing scenarios**
- Forecast revenue under demand response
- Provide defensible analysis for **Mayor’s Office budget discussions**

---

## Tools Used

- **Excel** – elasticity estimation, revenue simulation, dashboards  
- **Power BI** – planned interactive dashboard layer  
- **GitHub** – documentation and version control
