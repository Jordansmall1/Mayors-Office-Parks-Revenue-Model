## About the Regression Analysis

For this project, I used the dataset provided to analyze how different amenities and facility types influence output (quantity sold) and overall sales performance.

### **Data Preparation**
I began by organizing the raw dataset and extracting key variables, including:

- `Price`
- `Quantity`
- `Revenue`
- `Product / Category`
- `Facility`

To properly model the effects of amenities, I created **dummy variables** representing:
- Amenity type  
- Facility type  
- Program category  
- Location-based characteristics  

These dummy variables allow the model to measure how each feature (e.g., camps, shelters, rentals, aquatic facilities, dog parks, open gyms, etc.) impacts the expected quantity sold relative to a baseline.

### **Model Specification**
I ran a log-log regression of the form:

```txt
ln(Quantity) = β0 + β1 * ln(Price) + Σ γk * Dummy_k + ε
