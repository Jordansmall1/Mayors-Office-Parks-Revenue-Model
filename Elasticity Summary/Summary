## 📊 Results & Insights

### Key Findings
- The elasticity-based model reveals significant differences in price sensitivity among facilities.
- Some shelters exhibit **inelastic demand**, meaning moderate price increases still raise revenue.
- Others are **highly elastic**, where even small price increases reduce quantity enough to lower revenue.
- The projected revenues (`R1`) calculated at proposed prices (`P1`) highlight which facilities benefit from updates and which might require reconsideration.

### Revenue Impact
For each facility, the model compares:
- **Old Revenue:** `P0 * Q0`
- **Projected New Revenue:** `P1 * Q1`

Facilities with:
- **Elastic demand** → Revenue often declines after price increases  
- **Inelastic demand** → Revenue typically increases  

### Practical Use
These insights support:
- Data-driven pricing recommendations  
- Forecasting budget impacts  
- Identifying locations for future elasticity analysis  
- Balancing accessibility with revenue goals  

### Overall Conclusion
The elasticity model provides a reliable, quantified view of how customers react to price changes. This allows decision-makers to adjust pricing strategies with confidence, ensuring financial sustainability while maintaining fair access to public facilities.
